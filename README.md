# Brief description. 
Easy Check is system that focuses more in students participation in classes. What we mean by that is, students can use their students cards to check in for attendance. Not only that but the software is integrated to be used for other functions. Easy check can be used to hold currency for the student and be used inside and outside the university campus.

- Proposing a contract to all electronic shops so the students get the disscount for any hardwear purchased. (Note, each shop has a different dsiccounted price on their products, so the students have to choose their shops deppeneding on what percentage they find more pleasing)
